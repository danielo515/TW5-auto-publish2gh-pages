By the way, if your computer is fast enough you can dare to switch on the "floating nodes"-option. Just open the Maps menu, click "Configure View" and under the "Layout"-Tab activate "Floating nodes".
You will then be able to drag around one node while dragging connected nodes with it. You can also play with the physics configuration in the map or in [[this Demo|http://visjs.org/examples/network/physics/physicsConfiguration.html]].
