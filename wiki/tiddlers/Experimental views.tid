You can now switch to three experimental views. The first one has zero central gravity:

<$tmap view="s2+c_exp1" click-to-use="true" ></$tmap>

The second one has a little bit of central gravity:

<$tmap view="s2+c_exp2" click-to-use="true" ></$tmap>

And the third one is still being experimented with.
