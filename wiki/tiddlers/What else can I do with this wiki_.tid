You can make changes right now to explore the functions of the wiki. They will only be stored inside your browser and can only be saved by either downloading the wiki as a single html-page via the "save changes"-button in the top right toolbar or by exporting the edited Tiddlers with the "export"-button in the Tiddler-toolbar. 

When creating your own [[TiddlyWiki|https://tiddlywiki.com/]] you have quite a few options  [[how to save changes|https://tiddlywiki.com/#GettingStarted]].

You can start creating your own Wiki by downloading an empty copy or you can copy one of my Wikis to start with them.

The only problem is: 
Working with big network graphs can be quite slow in a single-file Wiki and runs much smoother when operating on a server.
This wiki is hosted on [[Github Pages|https://pages.github.com/]] and is built with [[Travis CI|https://travis-ci.org/]] (CI stands for Continuous Integration). It sounds quite complicated, but thanks to all these great services actually isn't.

Without much effort you can run your own [[TiddlyWiki|https://tiddlywiki.com/]] [[on node.js|https://tiddlywiki.com/static/TiddlyWiki%2520on%2520Node.js.html]].

By creating a [[GitHub|https://github.com/]]-account you are able to fork your own copy of the source code and run it locally. 
You can then apply pull-requests and collaborate on my Wiki.
A more simple way of collaboration would be to just go to the ~GitHub [[source repository|https://github.com/samuelwiechmann/understand2]] and just edit or create Tiddlers right via ~GitHub and create a pull request.
