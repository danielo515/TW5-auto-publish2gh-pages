You probably noticed the map to the right. Give it a look. You can also switch to half- or full-screen-mode. 

The map shows all topics I included so far. Their purpose is to build a structure for interesting content. Because the selection of topics and their linkage is highly subjective I decided to also include myself into the view. I also included a progression of central topics bridging the gap between Me and the World as a whole to give some orientation. The rest basically splits into the three basic disciplines of science, applied science (technology) and the humanities.
